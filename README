Dead simple configuration management for simple scripts.

Honestly, it doesn't do a lot, but it does let you avoid putting passwords and the like in your scripts.

For example, if you were writing a twitter script, you could do:

config = Configura.new
httpauth = Twitter::HTTPAuth.new(config['twitter.email'], config['twitter.password'])
base = Twitter::Base.new(httpauth)

If you're running at the terminal, you'll be prompted to enter missing values - which will then be saved to $HOME/.configura. Otherwise a missing value will cause an exception to be raised.
